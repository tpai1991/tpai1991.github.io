        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a platform engineer with a keen interest in cloud and devops related technologies. The bulk of my work
            is done using open source tools and I love to experiment with the different tools on the market when it
            comes to automation and building cloud infrastructure.<br><br>In my spare time I like to play and watch sports
            like futsal and NBA basketball, and spend time with my family.</p>
